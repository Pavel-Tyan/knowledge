### Gradable adjectives

Most adjectives are gradable. This means we can have different levels of that quality. For example, you can be _a bit cold_, _very cold_ or _extremely cold._ We can make them weaker or stronger with modifiers:

> _She was quite angry when she found out.  
> The film we saw last night was really funny!  
> It can be extremely cold in Russia in the winter._

Here is a list of some common gradable adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.

|                |                                                                                                                                                    |                  |                 |             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Modifiers**  | _a little/a bit_ →                                                                                                                                 | _pretty/quite_ → | _really/very_ → | _extremely_ |
| **Adjectives** | _angry_, _big_, _boring_, _cheap, cold_, _expensive_, _frightening, funny_, _hot_, _interesting_, _old_, _pretty_, _small_, _tasty_, _tired_, etc. |                  |                 |             |
|                |                                                                                                                                                    |                  |                 |             |
### Non-gradable: absolute adjectives

Some adjectives are non-gradable. For example, something can't be _a bit finished_ or _very finished_. You can't be _a bit dead_ or _very dead_. These adjectives describe absolute qualities. To make them stronger we have to use modifiers like _absolutely_, _totally_ or _completely_:

> _Thank you, I love it! It's absolutely perfect!  
> Their farm was totally destroyed by a tornado.  
> My work is completely finished. Now I can relax._

Here is a list of some common absolute adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Modifiers**|_absolutely/totally/completely_|
|**Adjectives**|_acceptable_, _dead_, _destroyed_, _finished_, _free_, _impossible_, _necessary_, _perfect_, _ruined_, _unacceptable_, etc.|

### Non-gradable: extreme adjectives

Adjectives like _amazing_, _awful_ and _boiling_ are also non-gradable. They already contain the idea of 'very' in their definitions. If we want to make extreme adjectives stronger, we have to use _absolutely_ or _really_:

> _Did you see the final match? It was absolutely amazing!  
> After 32 hours of travelling, they were absolutely exhausted.  
> My trip home was really awful. First, traffic was really bad, then the car broke down and we had to walk home in the rain._

Here is a list of some common extreme adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.

|                |                                                                                                                                                                        |
