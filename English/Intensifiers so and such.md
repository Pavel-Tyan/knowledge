We can use _so_ with an adjective or adverb to make it stronger.

> _It's so hot today!  
> She looks so young in that photo.  
> He walks so slowly. It's so annoying!_

If we are using the comparative form of the adjective or adverb, we use _so much_ to make it stronger.

> _They were so much more innocent when they were younger.  
> I work so much more quickly when I can concentrate._

### Nouns

With a noun or adjective + noun, we use _such_ to make it stronger. 

> _You're such an angel!  
> It's such a hot day today!  
> They're such lovely trousers. Where did you buy them?_

However, when we use _much_, _many_, _little_ and _few_ with a noun, we use _so_ to make it stronger.

> _There are so many people here!  
> I've had so little time to myself this week._

### Saying the result

We often use these _so_ and _such_ structures with _that_ and a clause to say what the result is.

> _It was so cold that the water in the lake froze.  
> He was such a good teacher that we all passed the exam.  
> There's so much noise that I can't think!_
